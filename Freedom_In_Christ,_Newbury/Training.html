Mark Broadhurst served for seven years as a Trustee with Freedom In Christ Ministries UK, and throughout that time was on their teaching team and served as their regional representative for the Newbury area. This coupled with his local knowledge of Newbury and years of serving with C.T.N.A. (Christians Together in the Newbury Area) ideally place him to speak at a local level here in Newbury on how F.I.C.M. UK can support your church in Newbury to establish an effective discipleship strategy.  Mark, and other FIC Newbury Team members, are happy to run the above two training courses for teams (using DVD resources) within any fellowship in the Newbury area. This will equip your team to form your own ‘Freedom Team’ in your Church to run the ‘Freedom In Christ’ discipleship courses and lead others through the Steps To Freedom In Christ. We aim to support you to establish your own ‘Freedom Team’ (to run your own courses) in your Church, so that you have an effective discipleship strategy that naturally lives as part of the life of your fellowship.
